# Teuthis

Teuthis is a concept for a modular and highly customizable decentralized software framework.
Instead of directly providing consensus, cryptography, etc. out of the box, functionality is injected into a
asynchronous event-based control flow. This design is highly versatile and offloads opinionation to
external "feature" modules.

As this project evolves, we will continue to develop self-contained features for common blockchain and
cryptocurrency applications as well as for novel concepts that emerge from the framework's design.

Let me know if you are interested in joining the project, and always feel free to drop a pull request or share
your ideas.
